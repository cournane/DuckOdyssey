						<p>We have installed security cameras outside of the house. Except where identified below, we use these for when the house is vacant, 
						   since they provide entrance views, as well as views of the pool deck. 
						   For instance, we can tell when a package is being dropped off, or when a maintenance visit takes place.</p>
						<p>But who likes being watched when staying at the house? So we turn them off remotely when it is occupied.</p> 
						<p>The exceptions are the sunset camera on the top west side of the house, with microphone enabled to hear nature
						   sounds, and the front porch camera (microphone disabled). We will leave these on by default 
						   unless you request that they be turned off. </p>						
						<p>Live links to each of the cameras are provided below. Again, only two are enabled by default when the house is occupied. 
						   If you want the other outdoor cameras enabled during your visit -- say, for security purposes or to capture family movies, 
						   just let us know ahead of time and we will re-enable them, at which point they will be visible here instead of the
						   "camera missing" message. We will need to give you special Nest access so that you can select clips from the
						   time period that the cameras are enabled.</p>
						<p3>We should note that sometimes these outdoor cameras stop working due to ground faults, other power problems,
						    getting knocked down in a storm, or software issues.</p>

						<p>We also install three indoor cameras during the off-season; one in the open area of each floor. Since they're
						   easier to take down, we physically remove them from May through August. You are welcome to plug them in 
						   during your stay if you wish to capture a family event such as a dinner or a billiards evening. Just let us know!<p>
						<p>Of course we would ask that you put these three indoor cameras back in the owner's closet when your stay is finished.</p>
